Iâ€™m a CTO, Ruby on Rails developer and entrepreneur based in Bristol, UX
Iâ€™ve got more than 20 years of experience building software for early-stage startups, scale-ups up and enterprise organisations.

In 2011, I co-founded a software consultancy called CookiesHQ. For 10 years I grew the company alongside Nat, my wife to a 15+ people operation and 7 figures revenue.

In 2021, we got acquired and Iâ€™m now enjoying building the future of age tech at Amba.

Alongside my role at Amba, Iâ€™m also a CTO in residence in SetSquared Bristol as well as an advisor to various small agencies and consultancies looking to grow their business.

## Why does this website exist?

For 10 years, Iâ€™ve been concentrating on starting and growing a business. While this was an extremely rewarding experience, I might have (sometimes) lost myself along the way. So this website is my way of reclaiming my personal side on the web.

I like to write, teach and podcast, therefore I expect this space to be filled with content around entrepreneurship, agency building as well as my first passion, Ruby on Rails and web development in general.
